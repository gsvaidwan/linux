-------------- Free SSL implementation from Let's Enrypt ------------------------------

First run the certbot command with your domain  → note use this where internet access

root@user-pc:~# certbot certonly --manual -d DomainName.gov.in
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Plugins selected: Authenticator manual, Installer None

Create a file containing just this data:
SUts8OCMBKTqULv1xm17ZVd1klYK_v8G6haqZhpRtl8.0sFR2fquGzsYokIBC5wR_k4AcKD
QP9e_OU1cbsXhSF8
And make it available on your web server at this URL:
http://domainname.gov.in/.well-known/acme-challenge/SUts8OCMBKTqULv1xm17ZVd1klY K_v8G6haqZhpRtl8
-	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Press Enter to Continue
-	Then create these directory in your DocumentRoot where application hosted as given by certbot
Note - In last there is unique file name →
SUts8OCMBKTqULv1xm17ZVd1klYK_v8G6haqZhpRtl8
-	Now suppose your document root is /var/www/html then directory and file should be created as below.
root@user-pc:~# pwd /var/www/html
root@user-pc:~# mkdir -p .well-known/acme-challenge root@user-pc:~# touch SUts8OCMBKTqULv1xm17ZVd1klYK_v8G6haqZhpRtl8 And now put these unique code given by certbot in the created file please see below
root@user-pc:~# echo
SUts8OCMBKTqULv1xm17ZVd1klYK_v8G6haqZhpRtl8.0sFR2fquGzsYokIBC5wR_k4AcKD
QP9e_OU1cbsXhSF8 >> SUts8OCMBKTqULv1xm17ZVd1klYK_v8G6haqZhpRtl8
-	Give the 644 permission to the file
-	Now verify with the given url on browser http://domainname.gov.in/.well-known/acme-challenge/SUts8OCMBKTqULv1xm17ZVd1klY
K_v8G6haqZhpRtl8
-	It should be shows on browser
-	After verification on browser hit enter
-	Now, it will give you certificate and private key with location where you have used certbot
-	See sample below :-
Waiting for verification... Cleaning up challenges
IMPORTANT NOTES:
-	Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/domainname.gov.in/fullchain.pem Your key file has been saved at:
/etc/letsencrypt/live/domainname.gov.in/privkey.pem
Your cert will expire on 2022-11-02. To obtain a new or tweaked version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run "certbot renew"
-	Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbotconfiguration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
-	If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:
Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate Donating to EFF:	https://eff.org/donate-le
-	Store full chain and private key in a pem file root@user-pc:~# cat samplefullchain.pem sampleprivkey.pem >> sample.pem
-	Now you can copy private and certificate pem on your ssl location of the web server & haproxy.
Follow below to implement on haproxy :-
> create a sample.pem file
> Then store privkey.pem & fullchain.pem contents in sample.pem > Now store in /etc/ssl/certs/sample.pem of your web server.
> And put this location on haproxy.
> e.g. bind *:443 ssl  crt /etc/ssl/certs/sample.pem
-	Now restart your haproxy and webservice container.

To extract public key from certificate use below command:root@user-pc:~# openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in cert.pem  > pubkey.pem
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
View SSL certificate info openssl x509 -text -in certificate.crt -noout
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Check Private key info openssl rsa -text -in privateKey.key -noout.
