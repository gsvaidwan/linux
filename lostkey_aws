Step 1:
Create new Key Pair

1.1 Go to the EC2 console and under the Network and Security section, select key pair option.


Key Pair section
2. Select create new Key pair

Create Key Pair
3. create new key pair. In my case, my new key pair name is “ec2-missing-new-kp”.

create new key pair
Step 2:
2.1. Now you can go to your local terminal and under the switch to the directory way, a new key pair file is downloaded.

After that type this command:

ssh-keygen -y -f filename.pem

Now we got our public key. So this public key wants to put our ec2 in the future. keep this safe.

2.2 Get this script and modify it.

Content-Type: text/cloud-config; charset="us-ascii"

#cloud-config
cloud_final_modules:
- [users-groups, once]
users:
  - name: username
    ssh-authorized-keys: 
    - PublicKeypair
---------------------------------------------------------------

Now you want to some changes to this script. Under the users: section firstly you need to rename your ec2 user name. In my case my ec2 user name is ec2-user. You can confirm this by going to EC2 connect section( I attached an example screenshot for your reference)

Note: You need to verify your username correctly.


varify your ec2 use name
After that in the ssh-authorized-keys section, replace the public key pair you got earlier here. The key which we have created(step 2.1)

#cloud-config
cloud_final_modules:
- [users-groups, once]
users:
  - name: ec2-user
    ssh-authorized-keys: 
    - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDTbmAuTDxr+2AHf3xgGizTErbIz4EglR7YgPO1c0XaQ+6Y8oCgJrs/gXm371fooGYaA/Uzc7AEM5aTNbGCiBbPWSP/GqsSyJTi4tkUrA7+88Z7RYR3bgBptdw3ZXMgXklMwBbp1gf8Dz6E9dHWBt2O6SrqGu63CjJyaG9pJd0crPYX3hBt0yn6zJ7E9QQbKi1Ar/ZZ4KPBxByRpLsqHutoltGgATeHmMQm/Krm5MnuUv9vdzMsVDlxBfKpfRStn7ZXlui5g5bAAgD4ML+SwZ78d7RxQTaYHwaDAEtVsBqA+f/deb4wQTjZXrBRKtl9nl+yRsJkGJbP7mat3AARkE3F

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3:
3.1. Now go to the AWS Management Console and stop your ec2 instance. (Keep in mind, If you do not attach elastic IP, your public IP will change during reboot)

Now select the ec2 instance and under the actions, tab go to the instance settings.


Go to instance settings
Under the instance settings, go to the Edit user data section.


Go to Edit user data
Now copy the entire script and you need to paste it into the ec2 user data section and save it.


Copy and save new user data
3.2. Now you can start the ec2 instance.


ec2 is in running mode
Step 4:

4.1. Now try to access the instance using ssh with new key pair.

Go to the SSH client and copy the command.


coping ssh command
Please note that rename your new key pair in the ssh command.


new key pair connect
Now you can see the new key will work.
